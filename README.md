This is a project from The Odin Project.
The idea is replicate the well known rock, paper, scissor game though the use of what I have been learning so far doing the course path. I will be utilizing mostly JavaScript concepts.
The computer randomly will choose an option, while the user will have to write an value in a prompt box.

<!-- This note was part of the first version:
